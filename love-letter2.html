    <h1>Our Little Moments ✨</h1>
    <p class="message">Whether it's laughing over silly jokes or holding your hand in silence, every second with you is a memory I cherish deeply. Thank you for being mine. Thank you for giving mea chance and thank you for always showing me what real love is. Your smile is the pretties I have ever seen, your eyes the most beautiful. I really feel like the luckiest guy in the world to be able to call you mine. I still remember the first day you said "I love you" and i remeber the way i felt after hearing that, the uncontrollable butterrflies i had in my tummy adnd the way i thought about you the whole night that night. It was unexpected but it was a beautiful feeling.</p>
