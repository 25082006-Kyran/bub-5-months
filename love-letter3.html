      We started as an unexpected couple, nobody saw it coming, not even me but it has turned into the most beautiful and most special thing in my life. If i had to start over i would still chose you, time and time again, over and over again without a doubt. You are my soulmate, my best friend, my everything. I love you so much buby and I hope you know that. I will always be here for you and I will always love you no matter what happens. You are the most special person in my life and I am so grateful to have you by my side. Thank you for being you and for being mine.
